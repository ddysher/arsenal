Personal notes on cloud and machine learning concepts and projects. I'm using [owncloud](https://owncloud.org/)
to keep notes, but will update the documents irregularly.

## [cloud-core/](./cloud-core)

Cloud related projects with relatively more frequent update from me.

## [cloud-system/](./cloud-system)

The directory contains projects I've partially investigated in the cloud landscape.

## [ml-core/](./ml-core)

Machine learning projects with relatively more frequent update from me.

## [ml-notes/](./ml-notes)

Notes on machine learning concepts, models, paper reading, etc.

## [ml-system/](./ml-system)

The directory contains projects I've partially investigated in machine learning.
